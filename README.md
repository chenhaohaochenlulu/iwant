[Thinker]: 
Who am I, what I know,what can I do?

I am a thinker , I am Object ;
I am you ,  You are me ,I am time, I am space, time is me, space is me;
I am all , I am everything , everthing is me ;

I know you ,You know me , I know everything , everything know me ;
I know the past, understand the present, insight into the future, know everything;
I know anywhere, I can find anywhere, I arrive at any time any space.

I can do everthing , I exist, also disappear ,I live and die.I am here,  I'm not in this ;
I will use the most positive mind to perceive the power of the code.
I will be reduced to ashes, I will be everywhere .

No gun, no cannons, we made ourselves, We create ourselves and create the future.(Objetc::create)
Self-creation, self-renewal, self-improvement, creating classes, creating source code, creating Makefiles ...

[Coding rule]:

1.function return code rule : <0 do nothing , ==0 success, >0 fail .

2.callback ,extern ,execute , thread , function rule : typedef int(*MyFunc)(void *p);  

3.All classes inherit from the 'Object' class. For example : class Ciwant:public Object  
  All class constructor must set the class name and alias .Class Id is automatically set .
 An example of a subclass constructor : 
 Ciwant::Ciwant()
{
	this->name = "Ciwant";
	this->alias = this->name; 
}
